This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

Works even when edited on github with Preview ...

This is a formula with factorial, powers of 2 and odd numbers I tweeted on the weekend:  
$(2^n)! \cdot 2 = 2^{2^n} \cdot  \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} \enspace  \prod_{i=2^{n-j-1}+1}^{2^{n-j}}(2i-1)^{j}$

Screenshot from Latex rendered formula shows that it might be too early to only use Mathjax over Latex:
